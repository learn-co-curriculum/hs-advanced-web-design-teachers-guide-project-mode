###SWABATs
<b>Students will understand the brainstorming and design process.
Students will develop a list of 3 possible ideas for their final project.</b>

###Motivation
 We’ve all been in the situation where we want to make something, but are totally overwhelmed by the blank page. The blinking cursor on nothingness. It’s totally daunting. Since we’re going to start working on our final projects, we’re going to first tackle the brainstorming process so that we each have a few potential projects that we can work on. The point of this course is to learn to build web applications, combining front end programming with back-end programming. <b>Let’s shout out and list all of the different topics we’ve covered thus far.</b> We can and should try to use all of these skills in our final projects. We’re going to work in groups of 2 or 3 people to build these projects out.
 
###Lesson Plan
<b>Innovation by design video:</b> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M66ZU2PCIcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M66ZU2PCIcM)

We’re going to be following the five step “Innovation by Design” methodology developed by David Kelley at IDEO in Palo Alto, CA. They’re one of the most influential design firms in the world and their methodology has been extremely successful.]

There are five steps:

1. <b>Let’s pick out our audience. Who are we making this for?</b>
-In the real world we would do a market study. We’d really get to know who these people are. For our purposes, let’s pick one person or group of people we know (it could be ourselves) and take a moment to think about them.
	+ What do they like?
	+ What makes them happy?
	+ What do they hate?
	+ What would make their lives easier?
	+ What problems do they have?
<b>Have students pick a demographic and follow through these steps.</b>

2. Let’s brainstorm. Act like a beginner. Pretend there are no constraints. <b>For 5 minutes come up with as many ideas as you can. There are no wrong answers. Just keep adding ideas, don’t think. Add ideas to post-it notes or whiteboard.</b>

3. Let’s figure out our constraints.
	 + Need to use HTML/CSS and JavaScript/jQuery
	 +  Do we want to add forms?
	 +   Connect to other sites (APIs)?

4. Let’s pick out potential projects that we like/might fit from our list. For each project explain it to a partner or group. Get their feedback. Listen to their ideas.

5. Let’s build a mockup/prototype
	+ Use whiteboards, etc.

6. Pitch to groups and get feedback on the idea.
